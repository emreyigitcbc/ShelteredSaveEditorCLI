# ShelteredSaveEditor
Simple sheltered save decoder/encrypt command line tool.

### Usage
You can run it on command line,
```bash
ShelteredSaveEditorCLI.exe <file path>
```

Or you can drag & drop your save file on executable file.

If your file is encrypted, the tool will decode it and create a new file in same path named `savegame_0x.xml`

If your file is decrypted, the tool will encrypt it and create a new file in same path named `savegame_0x.dat`

easy peasy lemon squeezy
